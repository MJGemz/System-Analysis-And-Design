Project Summary

My DriverPass project focused on designing a system for DriverPass, a company that helps students better prepare for their DMV driving exams. The client wanted a web-based system that allows students to take online practice tests and schedule on-the-road driving lessons in one place. The main goal of my DriverPass system was to help reduce the high failure rate among test takers by providing structured practice, real-time feedback, and progress tracking. The system was designed to support multiple user roles, including students, instructors, and administrators, while remaining secure, scalable, and easy to use.

What I Did Well

One thing I feel I did particularly well was clearly defining and organizing the system requirements. I made sure to separate functional and nonfunctional requirements so it was clear what the system should do and how it should perform. I also did a good job connecting the business requirements to the system design by making sure the technical requirements, security needs, and scalability aligned with what the client needed.

What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the user interface details. While I explained what each user role needs to do within the system, I could have gone further by adding more detailed user workflows or interface examples. This would make it easier to visualize how users interact with the system and improve overall usability.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on the main issue DriverPass was trying to solve, which was students failing their driving exams due to a lack of structured preparation. I addressed these needs by designing features such as online practice exams, lesson scheduling, progress tracking, and instructor feedback. Considering the user’s needs is critical because even a well-designed system will fail if it does not actually support the people using it.

My Software Design Approach

When I design software, I start by understanding the problem and the client’s goals. From there, I break the system down into clear requirements, user roles, and system components. I rely on structured documentation and UML diagrams to keep the design organized and scalable. In the future, I plan to continue using requirement analysis, system modeling, and iterative planning to design systems that are both user-focused and technically sound.

Reflection on Learning

This project helped me better understand how system analysis and design connect business needs to technical solutions. Working through both the business requirements document and the system design document showed me how important planning and documentation are before development begins. This experience will be valuable in my future computer science courses and when working on real-world software projects.
